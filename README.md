Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis and Clustering
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis combined with unsupervised machine learning to segment customers for targeted marketing strategies. Three clustering algorithms were evaluated â€” K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN â€” with K-Means achieving the best performance based on evaluation metrics.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The goal is to identify distinct customer groups from transactional data to support data-driven marketing, retention campaigns, and personalized offers.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Source: Anonymized retail transaction data.

Format: CSV, containing customer IDs, transaction dates, and purchase amounts.

Processing: Aggregated into RFM scores for each customer.

ðŸ›  Methodology
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values.

Feature Engineering: Computed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values per customer.

Scaling: Standardized RFM features for fair clustering.

Clustering: Applied and compared K-Means, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN.

Evaluation: Used Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Adjusted Rand Index to compare performance.

Insights: K-Means produced clearer, more meaningful customer segments.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Results
Best Model: K-Means (highest Silhouette score, lowest Davies-Bouldin Index).

Finding: Rule-based segmentation aligned poorly with ML clusters (ARI ~ 0.099).

Impact: Demonstrates the superiority of ML-based segmentation in capturing complex customer patterns.
